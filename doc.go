/*
Package sounds generates and manipulates sounds.

Overview

Signals with the x-axis accessed as a time.Duration, and with types to help handle music.

Interfaces

Sound:- a signals.LimitedFunction using time.Duration rather than the abstract units of the signals package.

Note:- a Sound with a Period, signals.PeriodicLimitedFunction, set to a whole number of Period's.

Tone:- neverending Sine wave, a signals.PeriodFunction.

(along with basic access with whats in this package, as signals.???Function's, these interfaces can be manipulated by func's from the signals package)

Types

Compositor:- an array of signals.Function, potentially Sound's, that is a signals.LimitedFunction(Sound) itself, and is generated by adding together its contents.

(the end time, of the Compositor, that makes it a signals.LimitedFunction, comes from the longest contained signals.Function's, so at least one should be a signals.LimitedFunction(Sound))
